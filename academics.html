        <h3>Our Academics Philosophy</h3>
        <p>we have both CBSE and SSC curriculum available.However, what sets us apart is the Integrated Concept Teaching approach that we follow. As a part of this approach,we integrate the CBSE and SSC curriculum to create a concept based learning atmosphere for the student. We make learning fun by pairing up class room teaching  wit different teaching aids,practical sessions, activities,etc. Our overall education phisophy is to make education a stress free activity where students enjoy learning. In fact , we have a dedicated outdoor study area where students can sit amidst mother nature and study.
